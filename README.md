💻 Hello world!

👋 Hi, I’m Adrian, a data analytics passionate and software engineering enthusiast.
<br>
👀 I’m interested in posting in Github my own personal projects where you could find interesting ways of doing data analysis, data visualizations, data science, machine learning and software engineering.
<br>
<!--🌱 I’m currently learning about nodejs, tensorflowjs.-->
